Neutral Loss Rates

Neutral species ejected from solar system bodies are lost through collisions
with surfaces or rings, gravitational escape from the system, or interactions
with the surrounding environment. The last of these is discussed here. Three
loss process are included here: photoionization or dissociation, electron impact
ionization or dissociation, and charge-exchange. These depend on the local
solar photon flux, electron distribution, and ion distributions respectively.

Photoionziation rates for for atomic species have been calculated by Huebner &
Mukherjee (2015). The accuracy of these rates may be questionable in some cases,
but for now these are the default photoionization rates. See Killen et al.,
Mercury book, for a discussion of photoionization rates for Na, Ca, and Mg.
