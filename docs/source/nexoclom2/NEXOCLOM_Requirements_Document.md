# NEXOCLOM Goals and Requirements

## Statement of Purpose

The Neutral EXOsphere and CLoud Model is a numerical model for simulating
collisionless exospheres and neutral clouds around astronomical bodies. These
bodies may be planets (in this solar system or around other stars), satellites
of planets, or small bodies. The exosphere may be surface-bounded or start at a
pre-defined (possibly spatially or time variable) exobase above the surface.
Users can use predefined or custom initial spatial and energy distributions from
the surface or exobase. Inputs to the model are defined in a plain-text `.input`
file. The documentation species the structure of the `.input` file, which
parameters are required, and default value for optional parameters.

A full test suite with unit, integration, and regression tests is implemented to
ensure that physical processes are implemented correctly, changes in the code do
not change or break functionality, and that saved results can be retrieved
correctly.

## High Level Requirements

### Utilities

**Configuration**

1. Configuration file is a text file containing a set of `key = value` pairs.
2. Filename is set by an environment variable.
3. Required variable: `savepath` = path to directory where data is saved
4. Optional variable: `database` = Name of the TinyDB file containing the
   outputs database. Default = `thesolarsystemmb.db`
5. `user` is required if it is not set by the operating system (e.g. with
   Windows)

**Database Operations**
* sets the path to the database correctly
* Format as a TinyDB record
  * Strip the input classes into dict with only floats, strings, ints,
    bools, and dicts.
  * One-to-one mapping between class and cleaned up version
* Search
  * Builds a query only retrieves records that match the inputs.
* insert
  * Only inserts records that aren't currently in the table. This won't be
    100% foolproof since there could be multiple processes accessing the
    database, but that's acceptable.
  * Table containing outputs information that can point back to doc_ids of 
    the individual input classes

### Input/Output

***System geometry***

1. Specify the system geometry either with a time stamp or specifying true
   anomaly angle, central meridian longitude, etc.
2. Central object (e.g., planet or Sun) for the simulation is fixed
3. StartPoint is either the central object or a satellite of the central object

***Energy distributions***

1. Support for user defined sources either as a probability distribution or
   user-defined function

***Spatial distributions***

1. Support for surface maps in either solar-fixed or body-fixed coordinates

***Saved results***

1. Initial conditions specified by plain text input file in the form
   `parameter = value` or as a JSON file.
2. Inputs will be saved in a NoSQL database
3. When the database is queried only outputs consistent with the queried inputs
   are returned.
  * Some input parameters may involve a comparison (e.g., 5º ≤ TAA < 6º)
4. Outputs need to be saved in a format that can be used by packages that allow
   for larger than memory datasets.
5. There should be a way to include customized source distributions specified by
   the user.

- When doing fitted models, don't need any of the inputs like packets or Input

### Physics

**Forces**

* Gravity
* Radiation pressure

**Loss processes**

***Coordinate systems***

* Solar-fixed
  * $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ in planet's (starting point's) equatorial plane toward
    Sun. If the object's tilt is included this will not necessarily point
    directly at the Sun.
  * $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ in planet's (starting point's) equatorial plane duskward
  * $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ points along spin axis;
    $\hat{\mathbf{x}} \times \hat{mathbf{y}}$
  * longitude: angle from $+\hat{x}$ axis to projection of position vector
    on XY plane. Increases in counter-clockwise direction
    * 0º = sub-solar point; 90º = dusk point, 180º = midnight, 270º = dawn
  * Local time increases counter-clockwise from 0h (midnight).
    $local\_time = ((latitude + 180^\circ) \times \frac{24}{360^\circ}) \mod 24$
  * Latitude ranges from -90º (south pole) to 90º (north pole)
* body-fixed
  * TBD

### Solar System Module

* SSObject class
  * Objects that contain all the physical data for solar system objects needed
    by the nexoclom2
  * Required data
    * Object name
    * object type (star, planet, moon). Not really important.
    * What the object orbits (central object to be used for simulations that
      extend outside the Hill sphere
    * Names of satellites
    * radius
    * mass
    * GM (for gravitational acceleration)
    * semi-major axis
    * eccentricity
    * axis tilt
    * rotational period
    * orbital period
    * NAIF ID
  * Quantities with units stored as astropy quanitites
  * Data is pre-determined and stored in a text file included with the 
    nexoclom2 package.
  * Sources for data need to be included (listed in the datafile).
  * If object not found, return object with unknown quantities as None
* Function or class to object geometry relative to the Sun for a solar
  system object.
  * Can be determined either from a time stamp using SPICE kernels or from a
    specified planet true anomaly angle (TAA) or satellite orbital position.
  * Necessary quantities
    * Distance from Sun
    * Radial velocity relative to Sun
    * Object-Sun vector taking into account planet's tilt.
  * Additional functions needed to access SPICE kernels.

* Possible future work
  * Extended to include information about exoplanet systems.
  * Extract data from spice kernels when possible, especially for objects 
    that aren't in the included table.
