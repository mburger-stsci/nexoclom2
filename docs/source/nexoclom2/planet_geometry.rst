Mercury
-------

Mercury's rotational period and orbital period are in a 2:3 resonance: two
Mercury days are equal to three Mercury years. The consequence of this is that
the sub-solar longitude on Mercury is a double-valued function of true anomaly
angle. If the sub-solar longitude is :math:`\lambda` at true anomaly :math:`\nu`
one year, then it will be :math:`\lambda + 180^\circ` (modulo 360ยบ) the
following year and :math:`\lambda` the year after that. This is illustrated
below:

Also shown is Mercury's sub-solar latitude, which is always near-zero due to the
lack of any significant axial tilt.
